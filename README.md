# 📊 Regression Analysis Hub

Welcome to my Regression Analysis Hub! This repository is a collection of various regression analysis projects, exploring different techniques and datasets to uncover meaningful patterns and relationships in data.

## 🎯 Objective

The primary goal of this repository is to showcase and document my journey through different regression analysis techniques. Each project will focus on a specific regression method applied to a carefully chosen dataset, demonstrating the power and versatility of regression in data science.

## 🧪 Regression Techniques Explored

This repository will cover a range of regression techniques, including but not limited to:

- Simple Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Elastic Net Regression
- Logistic Regression

## 📁 Project Structure

Each regression project in this repository will follow a similar structure:

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Model Building
4. Model Evaluation
5. Results Interpretation
6. Visualization of Findings
